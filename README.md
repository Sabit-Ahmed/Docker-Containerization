*Problem: File sharing is off:  
solution and explanation: possibly the docker desktop gui app has been updated. There is a option called file sharing. The files of a particular directory must be shared. Otherwise the container will not be run using the host machine. That means containers will not be able access host machine resource.  
The file sharing option might not be there for some other variant of the docker desktop app. Need to figure out properly. There is WSL2 option instead of file sharing.  
According to Docker Docs : "The File sharing tab is only available in Hyper-V mode, because in WSL 2 mode and Windows container mode all files are automatically shared by Windows."
